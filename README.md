### Star Citizen a4.4.0 Hauling Route Planner

This simple web application will assist you in finding the most efficient route between pick-ups and drop-offs when taking multiple Star Citizen hauling contracts. You will be able to input each contract, multiple pick-ups or drop-offs, or direct types, commodities for each, and number of SCU. It will even take into account your ship's maximum SCU capacity to make sure your can carry everything at once or if it needs to drop things off before you can go pick up another contract.

_THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!_
